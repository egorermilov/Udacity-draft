## Capstone Project 
by Egor Ermilov  

### Description

In this project, I classified emotions on the facial photos from the Kaggle dataset. The dataset consists of 7 types of emotions. The dataset has been preprocessed, then a convolutional neural network has been trained on all the samples. I normalized the images, one-hot encoded the labels, built convolutional layers, max pool layers, and fully connected layers. 

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** with the following libraries installed:

* tensorflow
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scipy
* sklearn

### Run

To train the model run the following file:

* emotion_classificator.py

To classify a custom photo run the following file:

* custom_image.py

### Report 

To see the results open one of the following file:

* report.pdf
